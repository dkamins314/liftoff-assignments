### Overview
Many synagogues would like to keep their members informed about current and upcoming schedules, community events and public notices. Paper mailings incur continuous costs and many times are never opened. While email is cost effective, not everyone checks it daily, and for Sabbath and holiday observant Jews, it is not even accessible on the day it is needed. Paper  notices on the bulletin board can cover basic information, but is incomplete.

An Events Calendar that is displayed on monitors in multiple areas can provide an organization the means to get all the pertinent information to their members when coming to attend services.
It will automatically update the weekly Torah portion, Halachic prayer times, Sabbath an holiday candle lighting and ending times. It it an be easily updated for special Sabbaths, minor fasts and holidays schedules and changes in prayer times.
 The community note section has built in life events that can be customized to the membership.
